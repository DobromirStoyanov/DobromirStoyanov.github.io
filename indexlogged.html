                    <h2>'You'll be sorry,' Russia tells Britain at U.N. nerve agent attack meeting</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia
                    told Britain at the United Nations Security Council
                    on Thursday that “you’re playing with fire and
                    you’ll be sorry” over its accusations that
                    Moscow was to blame for poisoning a former Russian spy and his daughter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the second showdown between Russia and Britain at the world body
                    since the March 4 nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in an English town.
                    Russia, which requested Thursday’s council meeting, denies any involvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The attack has had major diplomatic ramifications, with mass expulsions of Russian and Western diplomats.
                    The 15-member Security Council first met over the issue on March 14 at Britain’s request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We have told our British colleagues that ‘you’re playing with fire and you’ll be sorry’,”
                    Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said during a more than 30-minute speech
                    that attempted to poke holes in Britain’s allegations against Moscow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He suggested that anyone who watched television crime shows like Britain’s ‘Midsomer Murders’
                    would know “hundreds of clever ways to kill someone” to illustrate the “risky and dangerous” nature
                    of the method Britain says was used to target Skripal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    British police believe a nerve agent was left on the front door of the Salisbury home where Skripal
                    lived after he was freed in a spy swap. He was a military intelligence colonel who betrayed dozens of
                    Russian agents to Britain’s MI6 spy service.
